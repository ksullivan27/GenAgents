I'm sorry, but your command to "pick a flower" failed because you are currently
inside the cottage. You must first move to the garden path outside the cottage
to interact with the flowers. To do this, you can use the command "go to garden

You find yourself standing at the edge of a tranquil fishing pond, its calm
surface disturbed only by the occasional leap of a fish. The setting sun paints
the sky in hues of orange and purple, casting long shadows that dance on the
water's surface.

To the north, a worn garden path, lined with wildflowers, meanders back towards
the comforting sight of the cottage, its windows casting a warm, inviting glow
in the encroaching twilight.

Lying on the muddy bank, a fish gasps its last breaths, its once vibrant scales
now dulled by the harsh reality of nature's cycle. The smell of decay begins to
permeate the air, a stark contrast to the otherwise fresh, earthy scent of the
pond.

Suddenly, from the thick undergrowth, a mean troll lumbers into view. His
grotesque features are twisted into a malicious grin, and his hulking figure
casts an ominous shadow over the peaceful scene.

The air is filled with the sweet scent of water lilies that dot the pond. To the north, a narrow garden path, lined with a riot of colorful flowers, meanders into the distance.\n\nAs a troll, your keen eyes spot a lone fishing pole resting against a nearby tree. It's a simple rod, its wooden handle worn smooth from use, and a line ending in a hook, devoid of bait. \n\nExits: To the north, the garden path awaits, a kaleidoscope of colors leading to unknown adventures.", 'You are at the edge of a small fishing pond.\nExits:\nNorth to Garden Path\n\n\n\n', 'You are at the edge of a small fishing pond.\nExits:\nNorth to Garden Path\n\ntroll sees:\n * a dead fish\n\teat fish\nCharacters:\n * A motherly figure\n', 'You are at the edge of a small fishing pond.\nExits:\nNorth to Garden Path\n\ntroll sees:\n * a dead fish\n\teat fish\nCharacters:\n * A motherly figure\n', 'You find yourself at the edge of a tranquil fishing pond, its calm waters reflecting the dappled sunlight filtering through the overhead canopy of leaves.

It might not be the freshest meal, but it could satiate your hunger.\n\nIn the vicinity, a motherly figure is visible. She is seated on a weathered wooden bench, her hands busy knitting a vibrant scarf. Her kind eyes and warm smile radiate a sense of comfort and familiarity.\n\nExits: To the north, a garden path, lined with lush greenery and blooming flowers, beckons you to explore further.', 'You are at the edge of a small fishing pond.\nExits:\nNorth to Garden Path\n\ntroll sees:\n * a dead fish\n\teat fish\nCharacters:\n * A motherly figure\n']
