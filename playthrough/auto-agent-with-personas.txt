Elena Blackwood steps onto the garden path, her boots crunching on the gravel
underfoot. The path is lined with vibrant flowers, their colors a riotous
symphony of nature's palette. The scent of blooming roses and lilacs fills the
air, sweet and intoxicating. To her right, a quaint cottage stands, its white-
washed walls and thatched roof picture-perfect. A warm light spills from its
windows, inviting and cozy. To her south, the path winds down to a serene
fishing pond, its surface a mirror reflecting the azure sky.

passing Grugg's action to Grugg
Grugg's large, calloused hands close around the handle of the fishing pole,
lying discarded by the side of the pond. The pole is a simple thing, made of
sturdy oak with a line and hook attached. He hefts it, feeling the familiar
weight. Now armed with the fishing pole, he looks towards the tranquil waters of
the pond, ready for a quiet moment of fishing.

passing Elena Ortiz's action to Elena Ortiz
Elena Ortiz, it seems there's been a misunderstanding. Your command to head
south to the fishing pond failed because you're currently at the cottage, which
doesn't have a southern exit. You need to return to the garden path first before
you can head south. Try using the command 'go back to garden path' first, then
'head south to fishing pond'.

Elena Blackwood steps onto the soft, grassy edge of the small fishing pond. The
water is clear and calm, reflecting the sky above. The peaceful chirping of
birds and the gentle rustle of leaves in the wind create a serene symphony. To
the north, the path leads back to the vibrant garden.

Nearby, a figure stands by the water's edge. It's Grugg, the Guardian of the
Drawbridge. His age is unknown, but his weathered face and stoic demeanor speak
of years spent in service. He's a formidable figure, his large hands gripping a
fishing pole. His gaze is fixed on the pond, a picture of concentration and
patience.

passing Grugg's action to Grugg
Grugg, it seems there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. Your command to catch
a fish with your hands has failed. The fish in this pond are too quick and
agile, darting away at the slightest disturbance. Instead, try using the fishing
pole you picked up earlier. It will give you the reach and precision needed to
catch a fish. Use the command 'use fishing pole' to try again.

passing Elena Ortiz's action to Elena Ortiz
Elena Ortiz, it seems there's been a misunderstanding. Your command to head into
the cottage failed because the cottage does not have an exit. It's a small, one-
room building, perfect for taking shelter or resting, but it doesn't lead
anywhere else. If you're looking to explore further, you'll need to return to
the garden path and choose a different direction. Try using the command 'exit
cottage' to leave the building and continue your adventure.
