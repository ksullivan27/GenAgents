Upon the player's command to 'look', the game reveals a charming scene. The
garden path is a riot of colors, bursting with wildflowers and humming with the
buzz of bees. Sunlight dapples through the leaves of the towering trees, casting
a warm glow on the cobblestones underfoot. The quaint cottage, with its thatched
roof and ivy-covered walls, sits invitingly at the end of the path. Its windows
are aglow with warm light, hinting at the cozy comfort within. To the south, the
distant sound of lapping water suggests the presence of a fishing pond. The air
is filled with the sweet scent of blossoms and the gentle rustle of leaves,
creating an atmosphere of serene tranquility.

With a grunt, the troll reaches down and picks up the fishing pole. His large,
gnarled fingers wrap around the slender rod, dwarfing it with their size. He
inspects it curiously, turning it this way and that, before finally giving a
satisfied nod. The fishing pole, now in the possession of the troll, seems
almost comically small in his grip. His eyes glint with a newfound interest, and
he looks towards the south, where the sound of the fishing pond beckons.

Upon stepping outside, the mother finds herself on the lush garden path, her
gaze drawn to the humble figure standing near the cottage. This individual,
dressed in simple peasant attire, radiates an aura of quiet determination. Their
eyes, filled with an indomitable spirit, hint at a destiny far greater than
their humble beginnings suggest. The mother watches as they stand at the
crossroads of their journey, poised between the cozy cottage and the beckoning
call of the fishing pond to the south. The air is thick with anticipation, the
world seemingly holding its breath as it waits for the peasant's next move.

Upon the player's decision to head south, they find themselves standing at the
edge of a small, serene fishing pond. The water is calm, reflecting the sky
above with mirror-like precision. The peaceful silence is only broken by the
occasional plop of a fish breaking the surface.

To the north, the lush garden path beckons, a vibrant contrast to the
tranquility of the pond. However, the tranquility is shattered by the sudden
appearance of a mean-looking troll. His hulking figure casts a long shadow over
the pond, his eyes gleaming maliciously. He clutches a fishing pole in his hand,
the rod looking absurdly small compared to his massive size. The atmosphere
around the pond shifts, the once peaceful setting now tinged with an air of
danger.

With a grunt, the troll lumbers north, his heavy footsteps disturbing the
tranquility of the fishing pond. He finds himself on the lush garden path,
surrounded by a riot of colors from the wildflowers. The quaint cottage, with
its thatched roof and ivy-covered walls, sits invitingly at the end of the path.

The troll's beady eyes scan the surroundings, finally landing on a motherly
figure nearby. She stands there, her presence adding a comforting warmth to the
scene. Her eyes meet the troll's, unflinching despite his intimidating
appearance. The garden path, once serene, now feels charged with an uncertain
tension as the troll and the motherly figure size each other up.

The mother, sensing the troll's menacing presence, wisely decides to retreat.
She turns and heads north, her heart pounding as she quickens her pace. She
finds herself on the familiar garden path, surrounded by the comforting sight of
wildflowers and towering trees. However, her relief is short-lived as she
realizes there is no exit from the garden path. She is at a dead end, the path
only leading back to the cottage or south towards the fishing pond where the
troll lurks. This is a moment of tension in the game, as the mother must now
figure out her next move. The command failed because the garden path does not
have a northern exit. Please try another direction or action.

With a gruff grunt, the troll lumbers south, his large form moving with
surprising agility. He soon finds himself at the edge of a small, serene fishing
pond. The calm water reflects his hulking figure, distorting it into monstrous
shapes. The peaceful lapping of the water against the shore is a stark contrast
to the troll's menacing presence.

To the north, the lush garden path beckons, a vibrant ribbon of color against
the tranquility of the pond. The troll's beady eyes glance back towards the
path, the presence of the motherly figure and the player still fresh in his
mind. His next move is uncertain, adding an element of suspense to the game.
