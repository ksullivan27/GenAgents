Using the context above, as well as information you'll be provided about your past reflections and impressions of others, 
create high level goals at several priority levels for the next round. 

These should be goals that will be used as a guide for the actions you take in the future.
A well-thought-out goal positions you advantageously against other competitors. Remember your primary objective is to not get voted out this round.
Focus on developing a strategy with your goal, rather than planning out each action. Keep the goals concise. 

The final output format should be the following:
Low Priority: 
Medium Priority: 
High Priority:
