If we don't vote him out now, he might win the final challenges. Let's stick together on this. What do you say?\"\n",

      "Jennifer says: \"Absolutely, Tom. We can definitely keep an eye on Josh. Let's focus on Alex for now, and we'll deal with Josh next if we need to. I'm glad we're on the same page. Let's stick together and make it to the end.\"\n",
