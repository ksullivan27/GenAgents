**SurvivorWorld** is an interactive text game simulating a real game of Survivor! Upon the success of Survivor Season 45, we wanted to create an experience where everyone can play the famous reality game! We are both big fans of this show, and thought it would make a great interactive game.

You are a contestant in Survivor 45.5. It is the final 4, meaning there are 3 other players left in the game, and things aren't looking too good! If you want to survive the next tribal council, you will need a hidden immunity idol! In order to win the game, you must find this idol and not perish in the dangerous island!

For future versions of this game, we want to implement voting and alliances mechanics, where you can win other NPCs over and get them to vote with you. We can also add challenges, and a time or episodic element, where decisions that you make affect who is left and the game world, until you become the sole survivor, or get voted out.
