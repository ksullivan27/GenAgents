## Project Summary

This repository accompanies our work in "[WORKING TITLE] A Framework for Designing Generative Agents in Competitive Environments". This work builds upon the great work of Joon Sung Park, Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder, and others who have led the exploration of using LMs as generative agents. We develop a framework to extend prior works to new environments, namely competitive game environments that require agent collaboration, deception, and strategic planning. We hope to answer the following questions that fall into two categories: 

[THESE QUESTIONS ARE IN PROGRESS]
1. Agent performance and behavior:
  * how do generative agents perform in competitive environments?
  * What factors (such as group power dynamics or internal personality) influence agent performance and are these influences consistent across trials?

2. Agent goal setting and achievement:
  * Can we develop a better understanding of how generative agents process and develop goals?
  * How quickly are intermediate goals met and are agent actions consistent with prior planning?

-------------

## Game Environment

We provide a sandbox environment in which all gameplay experiments were conducted. This sandbox is built upon a simple text-base adventure game created for UPenn CIS 7000 - Interactive Fiction by Dr. Chris Callison-Burch of UPenn and James Dennis [Affiliation??].

- - Discussion of game state set up?
